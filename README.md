# FIO Log Processor

This script processes FIO log files and exports the processed data to either an Excel spreadsheet or a comma-separated values (CSV) file.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- pandas
- openpyxl

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas openpyxl
```

## Usage

To use the script, navigate to the directory containing the script and execute it using the following command:

```bash
./parsefio.py [directory] [-f {excel,csv}]
```
**Assumptions**

- The script assumes log files were generated using fio's default output format which is CSV. If you used a custom output format, you will need to modify the script to parse the output correctly.
- The script will work with fio version 3.7 or later. If you used an earlier version of fio.
- The script assumes the log files are names are automatically generated by fio. If you used a custom naming scheme, you will need to modify the script to parse the output correctly.
- The script will work for NFS, FC, Object log files generated by fio. If you used a different storage protocol, you will need to modify the script to parse the output correctly.

**Example fio configuration file**

```bash
[global]
invalidate=1
ramp_time=5
iodepth=1
runtime=180
time_based
size=10g
bs=512k
log_avg_msec=1000
filename=C\:\fio\fiofile.dat
